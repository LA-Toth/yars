number of clients simultaneously.

This line describes the backup server's IP address. It is recommended to use
internal (class A,B or C) IP address for the network during file restoration.

This server-side port number is used to get the names of available backup images and their
lenght. Used protocol is TCP.
.TP
server\-req\-port 8766
This server-side port is for sending requests to get any part of the image.
Used protocol is TCP.
.TP
broadcast\-port = 8769
This port is client-side: broadcast datagrams' target port, the client use it
for listening. Because UDP datagrams cannot be larger than 1500 bytes, now only 1024 bytes
are in these broadcast packets. Used protocol is UDP.
